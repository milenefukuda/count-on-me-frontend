# Count on me

The "Count on Me" project was born with the objective of serving as a tool to assist organizers of protests in promoting and expanding their causes.

Some of the possibilities on the platform include the creation of a Landing Page for the protest, where supporters can leave their "count on me" vote and also check the basic information about the event such as the reason, location, and date. Additionally, the page features a countdown to the event day and also allows supporters to leave messages and comments for the organizers.

The project was developed using · JavaScript · React.js · MongoDB · Express.js · Node.js · Bootstrap · Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) · HTML.
